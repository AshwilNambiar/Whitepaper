DataLake - A hybrid approach
“Data scientists as well as large enterprises have been pondering over ways to fetch relevant information from the ever increasing and diverse data inputs. Traditional Data warehousing seems to be stretched to its limits and finds itself trying to match pace with the latest demands in data analytics. The concept of Data Lake is emerging as a popular way to organize and build the next generation of systems to tackle big data challenges, but there are concerns and questions for large enterprises to implement it, as Data Lake is still in its evolving stage. This whitepaper attempts to explore the potential of Data Lake to handle the future enterprise data requirements as well as its capability to challenge the strengths of traditional data warehouses. Further, the study looks into how traditional data warehousing can possibly evolve, and, whether a hybrid architecture of Traditional DW and Data Lake will prove to be a better option to handle the latest data analytics demands, than stand-alone solutions.”
